      It is now more critical than ever to comprehend the severe consequences of
      air quality on our environment. CO2 emissions continue to skyrocket,
      resulting in an increase in global temperatures and the alarming
      phenomenon of global warming. Collectively, the air we prize – the breath
      of life that keeps us alive – is positively toxic. It’s killing more
      people prematurely than almost anything else on the planet. Our mission is
      to empower individuals to lead healthy and rewarding lives, and to do so,
      we are committed to providing cutting-edge air quality technology.
